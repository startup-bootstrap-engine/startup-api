- Always look for pattern samples on the codebase involving what you want to generate. Please follow codebase patterns!
- Mongoose queries: always favor .lean and also atomic updates
- Note that models already generate types on the schema, so no need to generate twice
- no need to try catch on controllers
- remember to use return type on functions
