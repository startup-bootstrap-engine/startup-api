/* Ping Interval

General Recommendation: A pingInterval of around 25-30 seconds is a common default in many applications, providing a balance between keeping the connection alive and minimizing unnecessary traffic. However, for more dynamic environments like MMORPGs, this might be too high.

For Responsive Gameplay: Considering the need for more responsive gameplay, a pingInterval of 1-5 seconds might be more appropriate. This range is aggressive but can help ensure that connections are alive and responsive, which is critical for fast-paced game actions.
